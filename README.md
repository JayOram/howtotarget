# ðŸŽ¯ How to Target Email Clients

A collection of crowdsourced email development techniques for singling out email clients and platforms based on initial research by [Mark Robbins](https://github.com/m-j-robbins).

## Using the site

### A note on `foo`

Some code snippets include `foo` or `.foo`. This is [placeholder code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar) meant to be replaced with your own class names and styles. 

For example, the site lists the following method for targetting Gmail:

```css
u + .body .foo

```

To target Gmail in your own code, you might write something like this:

```css
u + .body .your-class {
  background-color: red;
}
```

* All hacks/methods are added one per file in [hacks/_posts](https://github.com/dylanatsmith/howtotarget/tree/master/hacks/_posts)
* Files are named `YYYY-MM-DD-client-platform-version.md`
* [Front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) should include client, platform, version, status, and contributor
  * `client` is the name of the email client (ex: Gmail, Apple Mail)
  * `platform` is the operating system or OS category (usually one of iOS, Android, desktop, mobile, or webmail) 
  * `version` is usually a number corresponding to the client (ex: `12.4` for Apple Mail 12.4)
  * `status` must be one of Working (tested and confirmed), Unknown (not confirmed), or Deprecated (confirmed no longer working)
  * `contributor` is your name in Title Case
  * **Note:** All fields should be present; if not applicable, leave blank
* Code blocks should always be wrapped in [fences](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) ( ` ``` `) with the language name appended to the opening fence (ex: ` ```html` or ` ```css`)
* Explanations of how and why the code works are encouraged and should be added below the code snippets; this can include markup like inline code and links

If this is your first contribution, you should also add yourself to [contributors.yml](https://github.com/dylanatsmith/howtotarget/blob/master/_data/contributors.yml) in alphabetical order.
