# ðŸŽ¯ How to Target Email Clients

A collection of crowdsourced email development techniques for singling out email clients and platforms based on initial research by [Mark Robbins](https://github.com/m-j-robbins).

## Using the site

### A note on `foo`

Some code snippets include `foo` or `.foo`. This is [placeholder code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar) meant to be replaced with your own class names and styles. 

For example, the site lists the following method for targetting Gmail:

```css
u + .body .foo

```

To target Gmail in your own code, you might write something like this:

```css
u + .body .your-class {
  background-color: red;
}
```
