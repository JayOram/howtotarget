```css
.ShadowHTML .your-class-name {
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}
```

The class name `ShadowHTML` is added by superhuman email client. They also add a number of other classes such as `ShadowBody`, `ShadowWrapper`. One that might be interesting if you ever need to only target mac is they add a class of `Platform-mac`.
